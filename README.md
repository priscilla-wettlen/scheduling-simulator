A framework to simulate CPU scheduling. 

The goal is to get familiar with different scheduling algorithms. Therefore, several functionalities are left empty and need to be implemented. 

The folder data contains testfiles for processes. Each line is of the format 
    id; arrivalTime; burstTime
or
    id; arrivalTime; burstTime; priority
and the processes are sorted by arrival time.
